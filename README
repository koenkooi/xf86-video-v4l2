Video4Linux2 adaptor driver for XFree86 v4.0

Developed by Rob Clark <rob@ti.com> based on xf86-video-v4l driver by
        Gerd Knorr <kraxel@goldbach.in-berlin.de> and
        David Woodhouse <David.Woodhouse@mvhi.com>

Example Configuration:

  # example config with defaults shown:
  Section "Module"
      SubSection "v4l2"
          # Enable more verbose debug output to Xorg log
          Option "Debug" "off"

          # The devices managed by the v4l2 xv driver should be specified
          # as a comma separated list of one or more v4l2 device file
          # paths.  Any character other than comma is interpreted as part
          # of the filename, so don't include spaces unless it is part of
          # the filename.
          # NOTE: devices should be listed in increasing order starting
          # with the first v4l2 display device.. (I'm not yet sure if it
          # is possible to lift this restriction somehow.)
          Option "Devices" "/dev/video1,/dev/video2,/dev/video3"

          # Use alpha blending to composite video, if supported by device
          Option "Alpha" "on"

          # The color-key value to use, if alpha blending is not enabled
          # or not supported by the device
          Option "ColorKey" "0x0000ff00"
